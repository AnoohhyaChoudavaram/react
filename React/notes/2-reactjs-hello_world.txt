We us create react app -> which is a command line interface tool.
# npx create-react-app <name of the project>
# npx create-react-app hello-world
# cd hello-world
# npm start

-> npx is a npm package runner -> create the package
-> npm -> we need to install create-react-app -g globally
and create-react-app <project_name>
-> here we not need to install the npm gloabally
instead of this we use npx.
