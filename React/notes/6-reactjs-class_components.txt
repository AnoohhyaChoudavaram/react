Class components;
-> Class components are basically es6 classes, similar to a fuctional component a class component also can 
optinally receive props as input and return HTML, apart from the props a class component can also maintain a private internal state in
simpler words it can maintain some information which is private to that component and use that information to
describe the user interface.

properties(props) ---> ES6 ---> HTML (jsx)

----------fuctional vs Class components-------------

fuctional:
-> Simple fuctions receiving props and returning a declaration.
-> use the fuctional components as much as possible and by that I mean if it is possible to create a component
with both the approaches always go with the fuctional component approach
=> first advantage of using a fuctional component over teh class component is the absence of this keyword
- which we will encounter in a class-based component this keyword
->(absence of this keyword)
=> forced to think of a solution without having to use state, if we have a number of components
each with their own private state maintenance and debugging our application -> kind of difficult.
->(mainly responsible for the user interface)
->stateless/dumb/ presentational components


Class:
-> more feature rich
-> maintain their own private data -state
-> complex UI logic
-> provide lifecycle hooks
-> statefull / smart / container components
