props -> short for properties is the optional input that 
our component can accept, it also allows the component to be dynamic

--> pass a name from app component to the greet component and render that name in the browser
to specify props for a component wespecify them as attributes, to specify a name property we simply,
add thename attribute we assign the value .

--> props are immutable, the value cannot be changed.
