What is React?

-> Open source library for building user interfaces
-> it is not a framework
-> it will focus on UI
-> Rich ecosystem

Why learn React?

-> Created and maintained by Facebook
-> More than 100k starts on GitHub
-> Huge community
-> In demand skillset

Component based Architecture:
-> This lets us break down our application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make
more complex UIs for example:
header
sidenav
main content
footer

--> Components also make it possible to write reusable code for example 
you could have the component for an article on react the same component
can be reused for articles on angular or view by simply passing the right data 
into the article component.

--> react is declarative, basically we does that mean well basically we just have to tell react 
what we want and react with its react Dom library will build the actual UI this is 
the declarative paradigm, now this is in contrast with the imperative paradigm, which we are usually used to 
which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

declarative -> gives the task and does not specify how to do the task
imperative -> gives the task and guides how to do the task.

-> React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components.
-> Dom updates are handles gracefully in react.
-> Seamlessly integrate react into any of your applications
-> Portion of our page or a complete page or even an entire application itself.
-> React native for mobile applications.
